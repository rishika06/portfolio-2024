        I began my web development journey in 2018, teaching myself HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. Since then, I've continuously grown, moving through
        different roles and gaining invaluable experience in technology, UI
        design, and teamwork. It has been a rewarding path of continuous
        learning and growth.
      </p>

        In November 2023, I decided to take a break to reset and focus on
        personal well-being. After this brief hiatus, I resumed my journey in
        June 2024 by enrolling in a DSA course for upskilling.
      </p>
      <p className="text-slate-200 opacity-75 pt-4 text-lg">
        During this time, I channeled my efforts into building new projects and
        learning industry-standard features to sharpen my expertise. I also
        achieved several certifications to solidify my expertise.
